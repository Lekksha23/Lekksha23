My projects:
1) https://github.com/Lekksha23/MarvelousService

A micro-service that handles subscriptions to services. I used Dapper to communicate with the database, 
the MVC pattern is implemented. Communicating with other micro-services via RestSharp or RabbitMQ with MassTransit.
Logging enabled. Authentication and authorization through a third-party Authentication service. All possible scenarios tested with NUnit and Moq (70% coverage)

2) https://github.com/ValeraPo/CleanMOQasine

Backend for a cleaning company website.
I used DI. Entity Framework Core. Authentication with a JWT token. Implemented MVC pattern.
Authorization is implemented for different roles. All possible errors are handled by the middleware.
Code tested with Moq library and NUnit

3) https://github.com/Arctic-beaver/KoCowork

WPF application for coworking system.
You can reserve a seat, order groceries (snacks, water).
Implemented MVVM pattern. Dapper and Linq were used to work with the database. The code was tested with NUnit.

4) I have experience with the following services:
- CRM (we had over 4 million records in the database)
- TransactionStore (was over 42 million records)
- Reporting service (containing information about all databases and providing interesting information about them)
- RatesApi (service that issues exchange rates)
- Service for updating lead roles
- Service settings that other services need
- Service Authentication. (Through this service, our services received Jwt tokens for leads and tokens for communication between microservices)
